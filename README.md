Mining my own gmail sent box
============
In this project, I mined my own emails sent over the course of 7 years as a retrospective process to understand who I've been talking to, what new friends I have made, what old friends I have lost, and what we have been talking about. The project is documented [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/09/what-mining-my-own-emails-told-me-about-myself.html).
